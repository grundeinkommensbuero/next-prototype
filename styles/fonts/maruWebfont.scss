  This is an agreement between you, the purchaser and/or licensee, and
  Grilli Type AG (hereafter Grilli Type). By purchasing, or downloading, or
  installing, or using, or otherwise handling the digital typeface software
  (hereafter Font or Fonts), you accept the terms of this agreement. In
  accepting the terms of this agreement, you acknowledge understanding
  and complying with its terms.
  If you do not wish to enter into this Agreement, do not purchase,
  access, download and/or install or otherwise use the Fonts.
  Outside of their legal use as described in this license, you may not
  distribute, lend, rent, sell, give away, publicly or privately share any
  modified or unmodified version of the Fonts.
  This agreement replaces and supersedes any previously made oral or
  written proposal or agreement between you and Grilli Type.
  You are purchasing the rights, meaning a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
  perpetual, and worldwide license, to use the Fonts as specified in this
  agreement. You are not purchasing the copyright to the design or any
  other part of the Fonts. The copyright lies with its original designer and
  will remain so, even if Grilli Type customized the Fonts.
  If you, the purchaser, are acting on behalf of the end user, you must ensure
  that the end user accepts this EULA as it is, i.e. without any alterations
  and/or amendments. You are not allowed to ask the end user any other
  price than the one offered by Grilli Type. By purchasing licensing for a
  third party you are not allowed to use the respective software yourself.
